            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

He that ſearcheth and ſeeth the hearts and reines, knoweth that the origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall motiue exciting me to put pen to pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per,
<pb facs="tcp:21749:3"/> was a deſire to beſtow ſome Spirituall gift on the Church of God, for the confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of the godly, the conſolation of the afflicted, the awaking of thoſe whom ſinne (like a poyſoneſome and drouzie Aſpe) hath lulled aſleepe in obdurate and daun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous careleſneſſe. I haue endeauored, according to the ſmall portion of grace gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen vnto me, to charme the deafe Adder; and by blowing of the Trumpet, to prepare the Lords Souldiers, which muſt fight his battels vnder Chriſts banner againſt iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie; to the end they may be circumſpect, and not preuented, or circumuented by their ſpirituall foes, that watch and walke continually, ſeeking whome they may de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoure. Many before me haue ranne a faire courſe in this race; and haue thruſt their ſharpe ſickle into this harueſt; in whoſe ſteps I gladly acknowledge my ſelfe to haue troden; and I freely &amp; voluntarily confeſſe, that my penury hath gleaned ſome bundles of eares that lay ſcattered in their copious fieldes. To him that ſhall obiect, my draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of water out of the fountains of others, and my reſounding (as an Eccho) of their voyces; I reply, that as <hi>Aeſchilus</hi> the Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>et, was accuſtomed to ſay, that his Trage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies
<pb facs="tcp:21749:3"/> were but ſmall diſhes of great <hi>Homers</hi> Suppers; ſo my ſlender repaſt may be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, the fragments and reliques of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licate diſhes of Learned, Chriſtian, and Godly Authors. And to them that ſhall twi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>, that heere is ſcarce ought written, that hath not been publiſhed before; what ſhall I retorte alſo? But that, either the forme is tranſformed; or the language al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered; or (at leaſt) the vſage of the latter Prophets and Euangeliſts imitated; who haue repeated much, and oftentimes ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>batim tra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſcribed out of thoſe that wrought before them, as their purpoſe and occaſion required. Is not this euident in <hi>Deuterono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie,</hi> the <hi>Cronicles,</hi> and the Goſpels? Is <hi>Paul</hi> aſhamed to write the ſame things to the <hi>Phillippians?</hi> Nay, doth he not eſteeme it a ſure and behoouefull matter for them? Is not the generall Epiſtle of <hi>Iude</hi> the bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of <hi>Iames,</hi> a compendious abridge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and recapitulation of the latter Epiſtle of Saint <hi>Peter?</hi> Therefore an intent, to prooue our doctrine conſonant to auncient and approued writers, (as <hi>Oecumenius, Theophilact,</hi> and other, aſwell old as Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derne haue done,) is not to bee miſliked nor reprooued. But doe I frame an Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logie
<pb facs="tcp:21749:4"/> in this reſpect? and not rather inferre with an eminent, ſound, and profound Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine, that he that helps himſelfe with the precedent workes of others, cannot iuſtly be blamed; ſince the holy Apoſtle affirmes that all things are ours; and are ordained for helpes and furtherances to bring vs to CHRIST IESVS. What ſucceſſe will accompany my enterpriſe, I leaue to him, who, though <hi>Paul</hi> Plant, and <hi>Apollo</hi> water, yet onely giueth the increaſe. If I haue brought but the leaſt ſtone, or ſticke, that may ſerue for the promoting of Gods <hi>Edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice;</hi> If I haue preſented but one threed, that may be vſed in the garniſhing of Chriſt Sanctuarie; If I haue reclaimed but one ſinner from the path of perdition, vnto the way of <hi>Paradiſe;</hi> ſo that any ſhall heereaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſay vnfainedly, my <hi>Soule</hi> hath been bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered by this Booke; this is the marke I ai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med at; and praiſed be God, from whom all good and perfect gifts deſcend. Some readers are ſtill deſirous of Novelties, not regarding to performe what they haue for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly learned: like gueſts, that diſdaine the meate that is ſet before them, euer longing after change and varietie of diſhes. Some Readers reſpect not what they read, ſo they
<pb facs="tcp:21749:4"/> be reading: Like thirſtie trauellers, that drinke of euery fountaine, not conſidering whether the water be wholſome, or hurt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full. Some Readers procure diuerſe Books, and boaſt of the ſtore and multitude of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, though they apprehe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d the doctrine but in ſmall meaſure: Like thoſe that furbiſh many weapons, and keepe them in their houſes; but are commonly vnexpert, ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to defend, or offend, when they are drawne to tryall. Some readers vſe Books, more for ſhew and oſtentation, then for ſtudy of Godlines, and reformation of manners: Like Children, that burne lamps and candles in the night, but either watch not, or elſe vſe no exerciſe, whence profit and commoditie may redound. At a word, ſome readers reprehend what they perceiue not, or depraue what they vnderſtand; miſliking matter or methode, or phraſe, or all theſe: Like the captious beholders of a garden, that reiect hearbs and flowers, whoſe vertue and operation they are jgno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant of; and blame the contriuing and plotting of that which they haue often ſeene. In this variable diſpoſitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of readers, it is not poſſible to ſatisfie the appetite and expectation of all: my confuſion craues
<pb facs="tcp:21749:5"/> order; my harſhnes deſires a ſponge; my ſhallownes longs for waight and depth; and therefore I am vrged to intreate the skilfull, to pardon the defects; the curious, to wink at the eſcapes; the vnlearned, to ſuſpend their cenſure; the reſolued, to beware of propoſterous and intemperate zeale; the lukewarme, and them that are frozen in their dregs, to ſuffer the words of exhorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; finally, I entreat all, vnto whoſe hands theſe vnadorned Treatiſes ſhall come, to embrace my good meaning in the armes of Chriſtian loue and curteſie; and to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member the bleſſed Apoſtles <hi>Maxime,</hi> that a man is accepted according to that he hath, and not according to that hee hath not, if there be firſt a willing mind. Finally, leaſt my preface reſemble a ſwolne head, diſproportionable to the dwarfelike body following; or become another <hi>Myndus,</hi> that had ample gates, it ſelfe beeing a very little Cittie; and therefore the <hi>Cynick</hi> flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tingly aduiſed the Cittizens to ſhut the gates, leaſt the whole Cittie ſhould goe out at them: aboue all other, I ſubmiſſely im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plore your fauour, for the acceptation and patronizing of my ſlender trauell; beſeech<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching you not to be diſpleaſed, that I haue
<pb facs="tcp:21749:5" rendition="simple:additions"/> beene emboldned, to dedicate this ſimple worke vnto you. I was prouoked by your zeale to pure and vndefiled religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, by your vnpartiall regard of Iuſtice, by your feruent affection to benefit your Countrey, and by your loue to Learning and the learned; (which vertues, as they are infuſed into you by the Author of all ſincere vertue, ſo they ſeeme in you to be hereditarie, and deriued and tranſfuſed from your gracious Progenitors;) by theſe things I was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoked, to yeeld this teſtimony of your de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerts, as a conſenting harmonie and gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall applauſe of the multitude. And thus praying the Lord, to multiply and continue his mercies vpon you and yours; I humble commend this declaration of my reuerent and due conceit of your worthines vnto your ſelfe, and your ſelfe vnto the Almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie.</p>

So muſt we doe. We muſt containe our mindes in the loue of God, and in the care of heauenly things, and not permit our affections to ſtraie aſide to the anxieties and diſtruſtfull cares of this world. Heauen is the preie which mans ſoule muſt follow: this it muſt deſire: this it muſt take by violence: this it muſt be carefull of: and on this it muſt beſtowe her chiefe deſire and ſtudie.

                  <p>And all this is plainely ſet foorth by our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour, in the parable of them that were called vnto the marriage.

The King that made a mariage for his Sonne, is God the Father.
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:21749:45"/> The Kings Sonne is Chriſt. The mariage, is the bleſſednes of heauen; which the elect after this life ſhall for euer enioy with Chriſt. The firſt &amp; worthier ſorte that were called, are the <hi>Iewes.</hi> The ſerua<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts whom the King ſent, are the prophets. The calling to the marriage, is the drawing to faith and repenta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce. This cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling the <hi>Iews</hi> deſpiſed, being giue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to the loue of earthly things: &amp; many of them, chiefly the ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> people, contumeliouſly entreated the prophets &amp; ſlew them. Therfore God deſtroied them by his hoaſts &amp; warriors, that is, by the armies of the <hi>Romans;</hi> Firſt, vnder the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting of <hi>Veſpaſian,</hi> &amp; after of <hi>Titus</hi> his ſonne: and hée burnt vp <hi>Ieruſalem</hi> their Citie w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> fire. Afterwards, reiecting the <hi>Iewes,</hi> God ſent the Apoſtles vnto the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> and called the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> into the place &amp; room of the <hi>Iews:</hi> in whoſe ſtéed they were, &amp; are, and ſhall be, vnto the ende of the world; as wel good as bad, that is, as well elect as reprobate; of who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, the one are, of euill made good, by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> holy Ghoſt; the other are left in their natural wickednes. The marriage garme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, is true holines; which is of <hi>2.</hi> ſorts; th'one is the holineſſe of Chriſts ſacrifice, imputed vnto vs by Faith; the other is an holines wrought in our mindes, by the ſanctification of the holie Ghoſt; which ſhews it ſelfe by holines of life. Whoſoeuer are not clothed w<hi rend="sup">c</hi> this wedding
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:21749:46"/> garment, ſhalbe throwne out from the marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age into vtter darknes; that is, into y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> eternall torments of Hell: and that ſhall bee done by the Seruants, that is, Gods holie Angels. Therefore beeing all inuited and called to the marriage of the Kings Sonne, that is, to the fruition and participation of the ioyes of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen; Wée muſt neither contemne and refuſe the abundant mercie of God, that ſo louingly bids vs; either by addicting our ſelues whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie to the vanitie and mucke of this world; or by deſpiſing of Gods Meſſengers, who are ſent to inuite vs; neither muſt wee preſume to approach, without the marriage garment, making onely a bare profeſſion, &amp; naked ſhew, without any ſinceritie. For though we ſpin Hypocriſie with neuer ſo ſmall a thréede, ſo that the eyes of man cannot diſcerne it; yet when the King of heauen, whoſe eyes are ten thouſand times more bright then the Sunne, ſhall come in to ſée the Gueſts, hée will pull off the vizard from the maſked diſſembler; and diſcouer the counterfeiter; and as the Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crite pretends onely loue &amp; amitie to Chriſts religion, and entends far otherwiſe with his heart; So the King ſhall Ironically and co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lourably call him Friend; but a painted frie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d; and therefore hée ſhall ſay; <hi>How cameſt thou in hither, and haſt not on a Wedding garme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t?

                  </p>
                  <p>Wherefore that wee may examine our ſelues, our ſoules, and conſciences the better; whether wée are arrayed with the Wedding garment, or not? and that we may labour and pray, that we may be more and more apparel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led therewith; whereby we may neuer be caſt out of the preſence of the King of Kings, and Lord of Lords; and that we may know, how to profeſſe <hi>CHRIST</hi> aright: For it is a moſt important matter; and to profeſſe is not e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough, except wee profeſſe aright: it ſhall be vnfolded; Firſt, what the Wedding garment is: without which, wee cannot be partakers of Heauenly bleſſednes: ſecondly, what Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocriſie is, and how deteſtable and odious it is in the ſight of God.</p>
                  <p>The Wedding garment is Iuſtification,<note place="margin">

All this is but true holineſſe; which is of two ſorts: Namely, the righteouſnes of Chriſts ſacrifice, imputed to vs by Faith; and inherent righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſnes wrought in vs, and brought into vs by the holy Ghoſt. So that this garment is of two colours: partly red, partly white. It is red, by reaſon of Chriſts blood, ſhead on the Croſſe, for the purging of our ſoules; and this
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:21749:47"/> is our Iuſtification and Righteouſnes before God. It is white, by reaſon of holy &amp; harme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>uerſation, which ſhines before the world; &amp; this is the putting on of the new man <hi>Chriſt Ieſus;</hi> &amp; the waſhing of our robes, &amp; the maki<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g of them white in the bloud of the lambe; &amp; our ſa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ctification &amp; holines in the eyes of men.

                  <p>In which words the holy Apoſtle ſhewes, firſt, what we are by nature: namely, vnwiſe, diſobedient, deceiued, ſeruing luſtes and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſe pleaſures, liuing in malitiouſnes, ſpight, and hatred.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, he ſhewes the cauſe of our ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation: namely, the bountifulnes and loue of God our Sauiour: by which two, namely, our owne vildenes, and Gods mercy, he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes vtterly in the matter of ſaluation, our righteouſnes, and our merites.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, he ſhewes the manner how we are ſaued; namely, by regeneration, and the renuing of the holy ghoſt: and in Chriſt we haue aſwell the one as other.</p>
                  <p>Out of all which this may be gathered;

                     <hi>I will that thou affirme;</hi> Hee ſayes thus in effect; I will that thou affirme theſe things couragiouſly, and with authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie; and that thou vrge this, &amp; inſiſt on this, and omit Fables, &amp; other vaine things, which ſome do deliuer. Auouch theſe things, becauſe they are true, and worthie to be belieued.</p>
                  <p>Here wee are admoniſhed, that Miniſters muſt ſtoutlie affirme, that which concernes Faith, and the edifying thereof. And we may gather, that the Miniſter muſt affirme no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, but that which is vndoubted &amp; certain; and that nothing muſt be taught &amp; preached in the Church of God, beſides the word of God. For who can be an affirmer, or an auoucher, but hee that is aſſured, that he preacheth not the doctrines of men, but the Word of God?</p>
                  <p>And what is it, that the Miniſter muſt ſo firmely affirme? <hi>That they which haue belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:21749:98"/> God muſt be carefull to ſhew forth good works.</hi> That is, that they which haue belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued God, ſhould meditate on true, iuſt, &amp; good things. For it becomes thoſe that boaſt, that they are deliuered from their ſinnes, by the frée mercie &amp; goodnes of God, ſo to paſſe ouer their liues, as that they may anſwer the profeſſion of Chriſt, and not appeere contrary to ſo great and glorious promiſes. For they that haue the Name of Chriſt in their mouth, &amp; doe not follow his example in their life, are not vnlike the trees, that flooriſh euery yéere with leaues, but neuer bring foorth fruite. They are gréene indeede as the Boxe trée; but they yéeld either no fruite, or little fruite. For they ſéeke their owne, and reſpect their owne; but they do not ſeeke and reſpect that which concerns the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie of God, and the good of their neighbour.</p>
                  <p>Neither is <hi>Paul</hi> ſo carefull of good workes; as to neglect the roote, which is Faith; while he gathers the branches and fruits, which are good works: but he hath regard to both parts; and (as it is méete) he giues and allots the firſt place to Faith. For he ſaith, that they which haue belieued, ſhould be carefull to ſhew foorth good works.</p>
                  <p>Whereby he meanes that Faith muſt goe firſt, and workes muſt followe. For thoſe workes onely are acceptable to God, that

                  <p>And the Apoſtle ſtayes not heere, but hee addes, <hi>Theſe things are good and profitable vnto men.</hi> In which words hee yeeldes the reaſon, why he commands <hi>Titu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

The day then of iudgement muſt néedes be vncertaine: ſince Chriſt ſets it forth by very ſudden things; to wit, <hi>Noahs</hi> floud, a théefe, a ſnare. And the cauſe of the vncertaine day thereof is, that we ſhould take héede, beware, watch, pray, and be prepared. If the bird, or beaſt did know of the ſnare before hand, how carefully would they auoid it? For if the bird, or beaſt once eſcape out of the ſnare, they will hardly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne to that place againe. Againſt théeues men build ſtrong houſes: and ſhut their doores with lockes and barres; and kéepe their dwellings with dogges, and watchmen, and weapons.

For ſuch is mens curioſitie, that neglecting things neceſſarie to be knowne, they moſt ſcrupulouſly deſire to know that which God hath not vouchſafed to reueale vnto them. The Apoſtles themſelues were attainted of this curioſitie; and for this cauſe Chriſt ſaid vnto them; when they aſked, whether hee would reſtore the kingdome to <hi>Iſrael; It is not for you,</hi>

                  <p>Therefore to draw vs from this curioſitie, and to cut off all occaſion of enquirie, after that Chriſt had diſcouered of his comming, and the occurrences thereof, hee preſently
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:21749:147"/> ſpeakes of the vncertaine day and houre ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of. For hee would haue the day of his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming to be ſo looked for and hoped for, as that none ſhould preſume to enquire, when hee would come; and he would haue his diſciples to walke in ſuch light of faith, as that being vncertaine of the time, they ſhould patiently waite for the reuelation thereof. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we muſt take héede, that we be not more carefull and curious, in the ſeaſons, and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of time, then the Lord doth permit. For the chiefeſt part of Chriſtian wiſedome conſiſteth herein, that we containe our ſelues within the limits and precincts of the word of God. And therefore when the Apoſtle for the conſolation of the godly, had fore-tolde ſome things of the laſt times and Chriſtes com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming, hee immediately addeth againſt this curioſitie; <hi>But of the times and ſeaſons,</hi>

Were it not too great pride, and too importunate deſire, for vs wormes and wretches that créepe on the earth, to ſéeke to know more then the Angels of heauen?

                  <p>And it may be, that the malice of the <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians,</hi> who by this place laboured to prooue, that Chriſt was not the true and onely God, enforced them to this ſtarting hole, as to ſay, that Chriſt knew not the houre of the Iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, becauſe he would not reueale it vnto other.</p>
                  <p>But ſéeing it is cleare, that an ignorance is attributed to Chriſt, common with the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels, ſome other fitter meaning muſt be ſought out of theſe words. For it is nothing to ſay, that Chriſt is God, and God is igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant of nothing: for there are in Chriſt two natures, ſo ioyned in one perſon, that each nature retaineth it owne proprieties; and ſpecially the <hi>Deitie</hi> did (as it were) reſt, and not ſhew it ſelfe foorth, as often as for the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhing of the office of the Mediator, it was requiſite, that the humane nature ſhould by it ſelfe worke that which appertained vnto
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:21749:148"/> it. Therefore it is no abſurditie, for Chriſt that knew all things, as hee is God, to be ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant of ſomething, as he is man. How elſe could he haue beene like vnto vs, and ſubiect to griefe and heauineſſe? And it is a great ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurditie for any to reply; that ignorance, which is the puniſhment for ſinne, beſéemeth not Chriſt. For firſt, it is folly, to thinke, that the ignorance, which is here aſcribed to the Angels, procéedeth from ſinne, and againe it is folly, not to acknowledge, that Chriſt tooke vpon him our fleſh, to the end he might vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goe the puniſhments that were due to our ſinnes. And that Chriſt knew not the day and ha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>Now queſtionleſſe, Chriſt in attributing this ignorance to himſelfe, had reſpect to the office enioyned him by his Father: as he did, when he ſaid, that it was not his part,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Math.</hi> 20.23.24.</note> to place any on his right, or left hand, in the kingdome of heauen.</p>
                  <p>For he doth not there abſolutely derogate that authoritie from himſelfe, but the ſenſe is, that he was not ſent from the Father, with this commandement, while hee liued among men: ſo héere alſo we muſt vnderſtand, that
<pb n="308" facs="tcp:21749:149"/> as hee deſcended to be our Mediator, till he had executed that office, he had not that giuen him, which he receiued after his reſurrection. For hee affirmeth, that then the power ouer all things is giuen vnto him.<note place="margin">

                  <p>Conſider how Weomen are griped with ſudden griefe, when the time of Trauell ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takes them; and how their griefe is ſo great, that they are little diſtant from death; but when they haue brought foorth a Childe, their ioye is by ſo much the greater, by how much their anguiſh was the extreamer. So you, that are my Diſciples, &amp; are in trauell, that is, ſhalbe renued by the regeneration of the holy Ghoſt, you ſhall firſt be vehemently diſtreſſed and afflicted: And becauſe the Lorde ſhall
<pb n="339" facs="tcp:21749:168"/> withdrawe his helpe, and ſéeme to ſtand on your Aduerſaries parte, you ſhall reckon your condition to be forlorne and deſperate; But when the day of Redemption ſhall come, you ſhalbe refreſhed with vnexpected ioy, and your perplexitie ſhall not bee comparable to your conſolation.</p>
                  <p>And when I ſhall ſée you, and viſite you, by the graces of the holy Ghoſt, this your ioy ſhall not be Fléeting and tranſitorie, like the worldly ioye: but true, ſolide, and permanent.</p>
                  <p>The world muſt needes be quickly depri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued of their ioyes; becauſe they ſeeke them, and repoſe them in fickle and fading things: But I am the ioye and comfort of beléeuers: and therefore their ioy is perpetuall, becauſe I am perpetuall:<note place="margin">

                  <p>Therefore it is not ſorrow indeede, which is turned into eternall ioy; Nor it is not ioy indéede, which is turned into eternall ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row:</p>
                  <p>Therefore the wicked are not bleſſed, which reioyce in this world, &amp; in the world to come, ſhall for euer be ſorrie, wéepe, and howle; Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther are the godly miſerable, that in this life are ſorrie, wéepe, and lament, but in the

                     <hi>Aphoriſme</hi> and ſentence of <hi>Salomon,</hi> the wiſe king of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> is a moſt pithie commendati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of liberalitie towards the poore and néedie; and therewithall an effectuall exhortation to embrace the ſame. In which ſpéech two things are pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented to our conſideration: the firſt is a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription of mercie to the poore; what it is: the ſecond is the fruite and profitablenes
<pb n="423" facs="tcp:21749:215"/> thereof; what it brings vnto vs. If any would knowe, what mercie to the poore is; he heares it called héere, <hi>A lending to the Lord: he that hath mercy vpon the poore, lendeth vnto the Lord.</hi> If any aſke, what commodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie redounds to the mercifull; he heares it heere affirmed, that the mercifull giuer of Almes ſhall be rewarded: <hi>The Lord will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compence him that which he hath giuen.</hi> So that the wiſe man mounts by degrées: almes on the poore is no léeſing of our goods, (ſaith he;) but a giuing: it is no giuing away of our goods, neuer to haue them againe; it is but onely a lending of them: it is no hazar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dous lending of them to a debter, either beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garly, that cannot repaye; or careles, that will be bankrupt; or deceitfull, that will defraude his Creditor, or denie his due: but it is a lending to the Lord of heauen and earth; who is both a faithfull God, and therefore will performe his promiſe made to the mercifull; and an almightie Lord, and therefore is able to recompence what is beſtowed on the néedie. As if <hi>Salomon</hi> had thus ſpoken: Hoorde not vp treaſure in this world; neither fixe your hearts on the riches of the earth, which is the bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken bag that cannot holde. For if treaſure be heaped vp on earth, it is vncertaine;
<pb n="424" facs="tcp:21749:216"/> it prouokes enuious eyes; it ſtirs vp thoſe of a mans owne houſe, and that conuerſe fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liarly with him, to endeuour to ſpoyle him. But if you deſire to haue your riches ſafely kept, why do you deſire and ſeeke mens helpe? The Lord is readie to receiue them, and to kéepe them, and to recompence them with large vſurie.</p>
                  <p>None can take them out of his hands; for he will keepe you and your riches ſafe: and when he hath done it, he craues not a recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence for kéeping, as men doe; but he himſelfe will beſtowe a reward vpon you. If you re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect gaine, and wiſh that your coyne may en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe with great vſurie: behold rare and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heard of gaine, promiſed by him that cannot lye; namely, a large recompence from the Lord of Lords.</p>
                  <p>Men doe oftentimes lend great ſummes of monie, vpon hope of gaine and aduantage; and they take but the word, or the band of a mortall man, whoſe breath is in his noſtrils: but you that giue to the poore, lend not to men; nor haue not aſſurance from men, to be rep<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ied, but you lend to the Lord, and you haue his word that abideth for euer, and his obligation and hand writing for repaiment. If ſome great Prince or Potentate ſhould commaund a crier to proclaime, that who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer
<pb n="425" facs="tcp:21749:216"/> would lend him monie, ſhould in ſhort ſpace receiue againe, not onely the principall ſumme, and that intereſt which the lawe tol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerates, but far more, namely twiſe as much; nay, an <hi>0.</hi> ſold: there would be none, when he ſhould heare of this proclamation, that would not preſently lend to that <hi>Prince</hi> as much monie as he had; and if he had none, that would not ſell away his poſſeſſions, and ſo procure monie, that he might obtaine that extraordinarie munificence and recompence of the Prince.</p>
                  <p>But if perhaps the Potentates promiſe and proclamation ſhould not mooue ſome, but that they would kéepe their monies by them at home, and not lend them; they muſt of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſitie, either be iuſtly cenſured of follie, in neglecting of ſuch great gaine; or be conuin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced of diſtruſtfulnes, in not yéelding credit to ſo royall promiſes.

When prophecying ſhall be aboliſhed, and tongues ceaſe, and knowledge vaniſh away; and when faith and hope ſhall be determined and ended; namely, when our ſoules ſhall come to that bleſſed life; then loue ſhall ſtill remaine: for loue doth neuer fall away. Can there be any vertue comparable to loue, that is the ſoule and life of other vertues; and that ſuruiues and liues after other vertues doe ceaſe and are aboliſhed?

And this is the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thenticke, irrefragable, and vndoubted Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie of that ſcripture, of which <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeakes, when he ſaith; <hi>Let the words of Chriſt dwell in you plenteouſly, in all wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome;</hi> that is, Exerciſe your ſelues in the word of God, and put it in practiſe.</p>
                  <p>The Word of Chriſt, is the Doctrine of Chriſt, and the word of the Goſpell, and ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally, the whole Canonicall Scripture;<note n="*" place="margin">The whole ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ture is the word of Chriſt, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it aimes at him, as a booke doth aime at the Title.</note> which is able to inſtruct in true Religion, that is in Faith, and loue; and therewithall, to ſaue our ſoules. And the word of the Apoſtle hath a great <hi>Emphaſis</hi> and force; in that he ſaieth not, <hi>Let the word of Chriſt be in you:</hi>
                     <pb n="474" facs="tcp:21749:241"/> but, <hi>Let the word of Chriſt dwell in you.</hi> And how? not ſparingly, and niggiſhly, and a little: but plenteouſly, richly, and aboun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly.</p>
                  <p>His meaning is, that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> doctrine of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell ſhould be very familiar and well knowne to the Faithfull, and that it ſhould be ſo farre off from them to be aſhamed of the Goſpell of Chriſt,<note place="margin">

For queſtionles, <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeakes héere to men and women of all ſtates and conditions: and he would haue them, not only to take a ſlender &amp; ſleight taſte of Chriſts word, but he chargeth, <hi>that it ſhould dwell in them;</hi> that is, that it ſhould be rooted and ſtabliſhed in them; and in all plenteouſnes: whereby they may daily profite and procéed in the attainment of euerlaſting ſaluation.</p>

                  <p>For there are ſome prophane and vnreue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent men, who handling the Scriptures with vnwaſhen hands, and talking of them with raſh tongues, doe ſpeake groſſely of God, and things pertaining to God: and doe carnally expound that which co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>taines ſome ſecret my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterie.

<pb n="574" facs="tcp:21749:291"/> clenſed from our ſinnes; and receiued into Chriſts Church and congregation, which is the ſpirituall houſe of God; and we are incorporated into Chriſts bodie, &amp; made members thereof: In the Church we ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally feede on the body and blood of our Saui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our Chriſt, and we are thereby partakers of Chriſts merites &amp; righteouſnes, to the fruiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of eternall life. In that then the materiall Church is the houſe of God, and the ſoue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigne Apothecary ſhop, where euery ſinner may finde a ſpirituall medicine and ſalue to cure the maladies &amp; infirmities of his ſoule: we may truely ſay, when we are going into the temple and Church, where we participate of ſo many diuine things; <hi>O Lord, we are not worthy, that we ſhould come vnder the roofe of thine houſe.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Laſtly, let vs contemplate on the ioyes and felicitie of Heauen; where is ioy without ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowe; plentie without ſcarſitie; glorie with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out enuie; life without death: where is the trée of life, and the riuer of the water of life; where the <hi>Seraphins</hi> ſing continually, <hi>Holy, holy, holy,</hi> and all the Angels and Saints praiſe God vnceſſantly with moſt ſugred and harmonious melodie; where the elect re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue the pennie of immortalitie for wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king in the vineyard, and ſit downe with

                     <hi>Abraham, Iſaak,</hi> and <hi>Iaakob;</hi> and where are thoſe vnſpeakable good things, which eye hath not ſéene, nor eare heard, nor heart of man can conceiue?</p>
                  <p>In that then God hath ordained vs to this eternall reſt, and from the duſt hath exalted vs to his heauenly kingdome; we may truely ſay; <hi>O Lord, we are not worthy, that we ſhould come vnder the roofe of Heauen. Thales Mileſius</hi> being old, and hauing deui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed ſome admirable inuention of the motion of the Heauens, he did communicate it with <hi>Mandrita</hi> another Philoſopher; who gaue him thankes for the inſtruction, and aſked, what recompence he ſhould giue him for the document: to whom <hi>Thales</hi> ſaid, <hi>O Mandrita, it ſhall be ſufficient to me, if when thou wilt vtter this which thou haſt learned of me, thou doe not aſcribe it to thy ſelfe, but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe that it was mine inuention.</hi> This a man craues of a Man: how much more iuſtly doth God require of vs, that if we haue any ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, or any knowledge, or any wiſedome, or any ſtrength, or any good thing, when we make vſe of it, we attribute it, not to our ſelues, but acknowledge, that it is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued from him? Wherefore, let vs humble and proſtrate our ſelues with this Noble and godly Centurion; let vs praiſe the
<pb n="576" facs="tcp:21749:292"/> Lord for all his bleſſings, with vnfained thankefulnes; let vs confeſſe our vnworthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes either that God ſhould come vnder our roofe, or that we ſhould come vnder Gods roofe, let vs amend our liues, repent for our iniquities, and expreſſe true gratitude by our good workes; that God may augment and heape his mercies vpon vs continually; and that Chriſt may heare vs, as he heard the Centurion; and that as by the mercy of God, we entered into the houſe of God, the world, and dwell therein; and as by the ſame mercy, we enter from time to time into the materi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all Church, which is the houſe of God; ſo at laſt by the fauour and grace of Chriſt, we may aſcend and mount into the glorious and magnificent houſe of Heauen, there to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine with him for euermore. <hi>Amen.</hi>

The Libbard takes the pray, not by purſuing and hunting; but by leaping and ſkipping; and if he take it not at the third or fourth leaping, hee frets with rage, and falles away, as though hee were ouercome. Such are they that would attaine to perfection in well doing at one iumping, and would be frée from all croſſes and tenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions at the firſt puſh; and therefore if an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pediment come twice or thrice, they ſtart back from doing good. But we muſt not leape and

For as in <hi>Cheſſe-play,</hi> when one draught, either is not made when it ought to be, or elſe is otherwiſe made then it ſhould be, the whole game and gaine is loſt; ſo when one good worke is careleſly neglected, or one ſin is preſumptuouſly committed, the whole fruite and reward of righteouſneſſe is put in hazard Wherefore let vs ſo runne our race,<note place="margin">
